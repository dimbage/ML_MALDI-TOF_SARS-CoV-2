## The raw data (spectra), R-code, and outcomes acquired for the study titled  "Application of MALDI-MS and Machine Learning to Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and non-SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Infections"

### Background: 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is an attractive technology to aid the diagnosis of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2 owing to its affordability and high-throughput capacity. MALDI-MS has been proposed for use on commonly available respiratory samples, without specialized sample preparation, a feature that makes MALDI-MS especially suitable for implementation in low-resource settings. Here, we assessed the utility of MALDI-MS in differentiating SARS-CoV-2 versus non-COVID acute respiratory infections (NCARI) in a clinical lab setting of Kazakhstan.
### Methods: 
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from in- and outpatients with respiratory symptoms and from asymptomatic controls (AC) in 2020-2022. PCR was used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI cases. MALDI-MS mass spectra were obtained for a total of 252 samples (115 SARS-CoV-2+, 98 NCARI and 39 AC) without specialized sample preparation. In our first sub-analysis, we followed a previously established protocol for peak preprocessing and Machine Learning (ML), which was trained on publicly available spectra from South American SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI samples. In our second sub-analysis, we trained ML models on a peak intensity matrix representative of both South American (SA) and Kazakhstan (Kaz) samples.
### Results: 
Applying the previously established MALDI-MS pipeline "as is" resulted in a high detection rate for SARS-CoV-2+ samples (91.0%), but low accuracy for NCARI (48.0%) and AC (67.0%) by the top-performing random forest model. After re-training of the ML algorithms on the SA-Kaz peak intensity matrix, the accuracy of detection by the top-performing decision tree model was at 91.0, 95.0 and 70% for the Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2+, NCARI, and AC subjects, respectively with a SARS-CoV-2 vs. rest ROC AUC of 0.97 [0.97, 0.98]; a high differentiation accuracy was maintained for the South American SARS-CoV-2 and NCARI. 
### Conclusions:
MALDI-MS/ML is a feasible approach for the differentiation of respiratory infections. Its utility would be highest in the early phases of respiratory endemics/pandemics, when limited knowledge is available on the infectious pathogenâ€™s identity. However, MALDI-MS/ML implementation in real clinical lab settings will necessitate continuous ML training to keep up with the rapidly evolving landscape of respiratory conditions.
